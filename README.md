# Mechanism_Design_Using_Python

## Overview

This is the code for this Medium article published by Alberto Cevallos on using Python for mechanism design.

### Content

* Part I: Build a Simple Blockchain Using Python
* Part II: Design and Code Mechanism
* Part III: Test and Evaluate Performance

Take into account that blockchain protocols couple different types of mechanisms for different purposes (using PoW or PoS for sybil control, or PBFT or Tendermint for decision making/consensus). Many combinations are possible but not all make sense.
Much of the design work consists in understanding what are the different attack vectors, governance objectives and desired  product requirements.

## Dependencies

* hashlib
* datetime

You can install the dependencies using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/). 

## Usage

You can clone the [blockchain.py](https://github.com/albertocevallos/Cryptoeconomics_Workshop/blob/master/blockchain.py) file but I recommend using the Google colab link and run the code from [there](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1U3Zp3SckhwussLox6Ko4lJCnUzl0lpE3).
